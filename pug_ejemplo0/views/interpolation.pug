            h2 Tag Interpolation
            p.
                This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
                Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
                #[em ignored].

            h2 Whitespace Controla
            p
                | If I don't write the paragraph with tag interpolation, tags like
                strong strong
                | and
                em em
                | might produce unexpected results.
            p.
                If I do, whitespace is #[strong respected] and #[em everybody] is happy.
